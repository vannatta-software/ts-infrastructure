# Progress: ts-infrastructure Monorepo

## What works

*   The foundational monorepo structure has been established with `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, and `lerna.json` at the root.
*   The GitHub Actions workflow for publishing (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) has been set up.
*   The core Memory Bank documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been initialized.

## What's left to build

*   Creation of the following conceptual TypeScript packages within the `packages/` directory:
    *   `@vannatta-software/ts-infrastructure-persistence`
    *   `@vannatta-software/ts-infrastructure-eventing`
    *   `@vannatta-software/ts-infrastructure-messaging`
    *   `@vannatta-software/ts-infrastructure-notification`
    *   `@vannatta-software/ts-infrastructure-clients`
*   Implementation of actual infrastructure elements within these packages.
*   Detailed testing and validation of the build and publish workflows.

## Current status

The project is in its initial setup phase. The core infrastructure for the monorepo is in place, and the documentation has been started.

## Known issues

*   No packages currently exist within the `packages/` directory, so `npm run build --workspaces` and `npm test --workspaces` will not have any packages to operate on yet. This is expected at this stage.

## Evolution of project decisions

*   Initially, a sample package was considered for immediate creation, but the decision was made to defer this to a later stage to prioritize the foundational setup and documentation. This allows for a more focused approach on establishing the monorepo's core capabilities before diving into specific package implementations.
