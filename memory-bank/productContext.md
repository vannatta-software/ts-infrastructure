# Product Context: ts-infrastructure Monorepo

## Why this project exists

This monorepo is being established to centralize and manage infrastructure-related TypeScript packages. It aims to provide a structured environment for developing, testing, and publishing shared infrastructure components that can be consumed by other projects, particularly those within the `@vannatta-software/ts-utils-*` ecosystem.

## Problems it solves

*   **Code Duplication**: Reduces redundant code by providing a single source for common infrastructure elements.
*   **Consistency**: Ensures consistent patterns and practices across infrastructure components.
*   **Dependency Management**: Simplifies managing dependencies between related infrastructure packages.
*   **Version Control**: Streamlines versioning and releasing of multiple interdependent packages.
*   **Integration**: Facilitates easier integration with existing `@vannatta-software/ts-utils-*` packages by providing a clear relationship and dependency path.

## How it should work

The monorepo will host various TypeScript packages, each representing a distinct infrastructure element (e.g., database clients, API wrappers, logging utilities). These packages will be independently versioned and published, but managed collectively within the monorepo. Lerna and npm workspaces will handle inter-package dependencies and publishing workflows.

## User experience goals

*   **Developer Efficiency**: Provide a streamlined development experience for engineers working on infrastructure components.
*   **Ease of Consumption**: Make it easy for other projects (especially `ts-utils-*` packages) to consume and integrate these infrastructure elements.
*   **Reliability**: Ensure high quality and reliability of shared infrastructure components through consistent testing and build processes.
*   **Maintainability**: Promote a maintainable codebase through clear structure, consistent coding standards, and automated workflows.
