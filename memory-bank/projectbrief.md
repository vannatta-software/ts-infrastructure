# Project Brief: ts-infrastructure Monorepo

## Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of this project is to establish a TypeScript monorepo named `ts-infrastructure`. This monorepo will serve as a central repository for hosting infrastructure-related elements and facilitating their integration and relationship with existing `@vannatta-software/ts-utils-*` packages.

## Project Scope

The initial scope of this project includes:
*   Setting up the foundational monorepo structure using Lerna and npm workspaces.
*   Configuring TypeScript for consistent compilation across all packages.
*   Establishing a GitHub Actions workflow for automated package publishing.
*   Initializing the Memory Bank for comprehensive project documentation.

Future work will involve creating and templating individual infrastructure packages within this monorepo.
